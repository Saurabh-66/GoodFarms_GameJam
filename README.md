# 🌱 GoodFarms

A farming simulation game built in Python and Pygame (submission for the Game Jam under the theme Growth and Decay)

## About the Game
GoodFarms is a 2D top-down farming game where everything lives and dies on its own clock. You till the land, sow seeds, water your crops and watch them grow. The world around you shifts between day and night, rain comes and goes without warning and the seasons of each day remind you that nothing stays still for long.
